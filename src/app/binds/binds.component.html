  binds works!
</p>
<!--Data binding coordinates the communication between a component class and a template view associated to it.
There are four different forms of data binding in Angular
They are : 1. interpolation {{}}
           2. Property binding []
           3. Event binding ()  
           4. Two-way binding [()]
      Each form of binding has it's own syntax.
These four forms of binding differ in the way data flow.
So if you want data to display data from component to view, you use the interpolation and property binding
if data flows from the view to component ,use event binding.
Two way data binding is a combination of the property and event binding. it is a continuous synchronization 
of data from view to the component and from component to the view.  -->
